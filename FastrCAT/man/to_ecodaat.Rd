Prepares data for entry into EcoDAAT. Prior to using this
function make sure that all issues brought up in the Cruise Report were
handled and that missing station information (haul information) has been
fixed using the fill_missing_stations() function. This prepares all
FastrCAT data files present in a folder and will bind them together as
one .csv file for import into EcoDAAT.
