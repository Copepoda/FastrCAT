\usage{
map_fc(current_path, map_type = "Stations", depth_range = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{current_path}{The path to the directory where the .csv file
generated by make_dataframe_fc is located.}

\item{map_type}{Determines the type of map which will be returned. The
default map is a station map. Map types are Stations: returns map of
station locations, Sample intensity: returns a map of sampling intesity
for each 0.3 decimal degrees which is around 30km for the regions that are
sampled hexagon, Salinity and Temperature: return an interpolated map using
inverse distance weighting method, set on a 0.25 decimal degree grid for
the average of the depth_range specified. If depth_range remains as NA,
then the entire water column will be averaged. Map types are as follows and
should be quoted: "Stations", "Sample Intensity", "Salinity", and
"Temperature".}

\item{depth_range}{The desired depth range for either the "Salinity" or
"Temperature". If the parameter is left as NA, then the entire water
column will be averaged.Takes a two value vector, a minimum and maximum of
desired depth range. For example a depth range of 5-10 meters would be
entered as such c(5,10).}
}
\value{
A map of the desired type and depth range for a single cruise.
}
\description{
Once make_dataframe_fc() has been run, then map_fc can be
used. This function makes a station map from the dataframe generated.
The rendered map will be located in the plot folder within the current
folder.
