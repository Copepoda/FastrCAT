\usage{
plot_ts_fc(current_path)
}
\arguments{
\item{current_path}{The path to directory where dataframe created from
make_dataframe_fc() is located.}
}
\value{
A plot of temperature and salinity by depth for each
station of a cruise. Plots are written in the plot folder and
are in the .png format.
}
\description{
Once make_dataframe_fc has been run, then plot_ts_fc
can be used. This function creates a depth by salinity and temperature
plot for each station. These are all .png files which will be located
in the plot folder within the current folder. It only needs to be run
once to generate a plot for each station. Each dot is a data point.
Check the profile for each station/haul.
